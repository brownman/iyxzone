      # where +type+ can either <tt>:chars</tt> or <tt>:words</tt>. +path+ is the path
      # to the dictionary file.
      #
      # The format of <tt>:chars</tt> dictionary is a collection of lines of the
      # following form:
      #
      #   freq char
      #
      # Where +frequency+ is a number <b>less than 65535</b>. +char+ is the
      # character. They are spearated by <b>exactly one space</b>.
      #
      # The format of <tt>:words</tt> dictionary is similar:
      #
      #   length word
      #
      # except the first number is not the frequency, but the number of
      # characters (not number of bytes) in the word.
      #
      # There's a script (convert.rb) in the tools directory that can be used
      # to convert and normalize dictionaries.
